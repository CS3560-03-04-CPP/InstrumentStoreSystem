# InstrumentStoreSystem
Our school project involves developing a Java-based system tailored for instrument stores. The system serves as a reliable assistant to store owners, facilitating tasks such as inventory management, sales tracking, and organization. Customers benefit from a user-friendly interface allowing easy browsing, selection, and secure checkout of musical instruments. Additional features include search filters, payment integration, and sales analytics, enhancing efficiency and convenience for both store owners and customers.
